## 📝 Quick Start

**Need help?** [Create a ticket](../../issues/new/choose) | **Have questions?** Check the [README](README.md) and [FAQ](docs/faq.md)

---

## ✅ Writing Good Tickets

### DO Include:
- **Clear title** - Summarize in one line
- **Detailed description** - What's wrong? What were you trying to do?
- **Steps to reproduce** - How can we recreate it?
- **Error messages** - Exact errors (screenshots or copy-paste)
- **System info** - OS, software versions, computer name
- **What you've tried** - Shows effort and saves time
- **Impact** - How is this blocking you?

### DON'T:
- Write vague titles like "It doesn't work"
- Mark everything as urgent
- Include passwords or sensitive credentials
- Create duplicate tickets
- Demand immediate fixes

**Example:**

❌ Bad: "Python broken, need help ASAP"

✅ Good: "Cannot import pandas on workstation-5 - ModuleNotFoundError after pip install"

---

## 💬 Being Responsive

### When Tim asks for info:
- ✅ Respond promptly with complete answers
- ✅ Answer all questions, not just some
- ✅ Update if situation changes

### When ticket is marked resolved:
- ✅ Test the fix thoroughly
- ✅ Confirm it works OR describe what's still broken
- ❌ Don't just ignore it

> If you're `waiting-for-user` for 7+ days, the ticket auto-closes

## 🎯 Priority Guidelines

**🔴 Urgent** - Server down, data loss, grant deadline <24h, security incident

**🟠 High** - Can't work at all, no alternative, affects multiple people

**🟡 Medium** - Impacts work but have workaround, needed within a week

**🟢 Low** - Feature requests, general questions, can wait

**When in doubt, choose medium.** Tim will adjust if needed.
