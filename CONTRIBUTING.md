Quick tips for effective help desk tickets.

## ✅ Writing Good Tickets

**DO Include:**
- Clear title summarizing the issue
- What's wrong and what you were trying to do
- Steps to reproduce
- Exact error messages (screenshot or copy-paste)
- System info (OS, software versions, computer name)
- What you've already tried

**DON'T:**
- Vague titles ("It doesn't work")
- Mark everything urgent
- Include passwords/credentials
- Create duplicates

**Example:**

❌ Bad: "Python broken, need help ASAP"

✅ Good: "Cannot import pandas on workstation-5 - ModuleNotFoundError after pip install"

## 💬 Be Responsive

**When asked for info:**
- Respond promptly with complete answers
- Answer all questions
- Update if situation changes

**When marked resolved:**
- Test the fix
- Confirm it works OR say what's still broken

> Tickets with no response for 7+ days auto-close

## 🎯 Priority Guidelines

- **🔴 Urgent**: Server down, data loss, critical deadline <24h
- **🟠 High**: Can't work, no alternative, affects multiple people
- **🟡 Medium**: Have workaround, needed within a week
- **🟢 Low**: Feature requests, general questions

**When in doubt, choose medium.** Tim will adjust if needed.
